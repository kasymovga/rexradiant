[-z-]: make rotate dialog non-modal
    


BUGS

MSI: installer bug with new folders? : create custom dir, click New Folder icon, type "FOLDER\" - gets stuck
GTK2: gtk2 crashes when trying to use bitmap fonts such as MS Sans Serif http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=142579
GTK2: alt+tab while mouse button is held down: see http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145156
UI: changing resolution in floating-windows mode can screw up window positions.
HalfLife: half-life maps saved in q1 map format are not supported - currently have to convert them to hammer map format using hammer editor. And vice versa.
Entity: creating a new entity with all the brushes of another entity selected results in the latter entity having no brushes.
SConscript: build fails if SETUP=1
SConscript: svn.py fails if not using C locale - set LC_ALL?
GUI: can't use arrow keys to navigate in camera view when capslock is enabled
GUI: screensaver causes: gdkgc-win32.c: line 905 (gdk_win32_hdc_get): assertion failed: (win32_gc->hdc == NULL)


FEATURES

- paint-select or equivalent (e.g. area-selection with occlusion)
- select-complete-tall or equivalent (e.g. subtract-from-selection modifier key)
- texture pane names are often illegible, because 1. they are long and overlap each other and 2. they overlap the outline rectangles around the images themselves.


Build: document build-menu xml format.
The build menu in GtkRadiant 1.5 is entirely customisable - you can make it run qbsp3/qvis3/arghrad or any tool you want. Use 'Build > Customize...' to edit the menu.

Menu commands are the shell commands that Radiant will execute when you choose the menu item. You can add as many commands as you want to a single menu item, and they will be executed in sequence. The commands contain variables, specified using []. The values of variables will be substituted when the command is executed.

For example:
<pre>[q2map] -bsp "[MapFile]"</pre>
becomes:
<pre>"C:\Program Files\GtkRadiant 1.5.0\q2map" -fs_basepath "c:\quake2" -bsp "c:\quake2\baseq2\maps\blah.map"</pre>
This uses the predefined variable 'MapFile' and the custom variable 'q2map'. 'q2map' is defined in the XML file, and 'MapFile' is the full path to your map.
The 'MapFile' variable is enclosed in quotes, because the path to your map may contain spaces.
At the moment you can only create custom variables by editing the XML file. A custom variable for arghrad would look something like this:
<pre><var name="arghrad">"[RadiantPath]arghrad"</var></pre>
This variable could then be used in a command like this:
<pre>[arghrad] "[MapFile]"</pre>

Entity: option to filter non-world entities (e.g. not func_group or func_static)
Rotate Tool: if more than one object is selected, with different local orientations, use parent-space rotation pivot instead of local-space
Brush: MMB+ctrl to paint texture on whole brush/patch.
Camera: add alternative highlighting styles (used to be J).
Doom3: filter func_splinemovers
Entity: draw arrowheads to show direction of connection-lines.
? MMB to select a texture should also apply that texture to all selected faces.

Brush: option to disable dots on selected faces when not in face mode.
Entity: draw direction arrow for func_door and func_button angle.

? QE-tool: click anywhere on xy view to drag entity instead of requiring clicking directly on entity.
UserDocs: how to use multi-vertex selection - replaces vertex-edit-splits-faces option:
UserDocs: how to use parent-selection:
  Parent-selection works like Maya: it allows you to 'reparent' brushes
  onto other entities than the one they're currently part of. To use it,
  select some brushes, select an entity, Edit -> Parent.
Textures: add anisotropic filtering.

TGA Loader: check that true-colour images with palettes are properly handled.
Module System: reinstate 'refresh' feature.
Surface Inspector: add button for 'axial' projection for doom3.
Build: fix hardcoded engine-launch commands - use similar system to build-menu command description.
Filters: use q2/heretic2 content flags to filter brushes.
? Surface Inspector: allow material names not relative to 'textures/' for doom3
Module System: add versioning for module-system api.
svn: remove install/ dir, create it during build process on win32
Editing: add option to choose the default startup tool mode.
