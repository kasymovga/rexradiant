// TTimo started adding portability code:
// return true if spawning was successful, false otherwise
// on win32 we have a bCreateConsole flag to create a new console or run inside the current one
//boolean Q_Exec(const char* pCmd, boolean bCreateConsole);
// execute a system command:
//   cmd: the command to run
//   cmdline: the command line
// NOTE TTimo following are win32 specific:
//   execdir: the directory to execute in
//   bCreateConsole: spawn a new console or not
// return values;
//   if the spawn was fine
//   TODO TTimo add functionality to track the process until it dies

bool Q_Exec( const char *cmd, char *cmdline, const char *execdir, bool bCreateConsole, bool waitfor );


// Q_mkdir
// returns true if succeeded in creating directory
bool Q_mkdir( const char* path );
