   BaseWindingForPlane

   Original BaseWindingForPlane() function that has serious accuracy problems.  Here is why.
   The base winding is computed as a rectangle with very large coordinates.  These coordinates
   are in the range 2^17 or 2^18.  "Epsilon" (meaning the distance between two adjacent numbers)
   at these magnitudes in 32 bit floating point world is about 0.02.  So for example, if things
   go badly (by bad luck), then the whole plane could be shifted by 0.02 units (its distance could
   be off by that much).  Then if we were to compute the winding of this plane and another of
   the brush's planes met this winding at a very acute angle, that error could multiply to around
   0.1 or more when computing the final vertex coordinates of the winding.  0.1 is a very large
   error, and can lead to all sorts of disappearing triangle problems.

	// We require at least a very small epsilon.  It's a good idea for several reasons.
	// First, we will be dividing by a potentially very small distance below.  We don't
	// want that distance to be too small; otherwise, things "blow up" with little accuracy
	// due to the division.  (After a second look, the value w below is in range (0,1), but
	// graininess problem remains.)  Second, Having minimum epsilon also prevents the following
	// situation.  Say for example we have a perfect octagon defined by the input winding.
	// Say our chopping plane (defined by normal and dist) is essentially the same plane
	// that the octagon is sitting on.  Well, due to rounding errors, it may be that point
	// 1 of the octagon might be in front, point 2 might be in back, point 3 might be in
	// front, point 4 might be in back, and so on.  So we could end up with a very ugly-
	// looking chopped winding, and this might be undesirable, and would at least lead to
	// a possible exhaustion of MAX_POINTS_ON_WINDING.  It's better to assume that points
	// very very close to the plane are on the plane, using an infinitesimal epsilon amount.

	// Now, the original ChopWindingInPlace() function used a vec_t-based winding_t.
	// So this minimum epsilon is quite similar to casting the higher resolution numbers to
	// the lower resolution and comparing them in the lower resolution mode.  We explicitly
	// choose the minimum epsilon as something around the vec_t epsilon of one because we
	// want the resolution of double to have a large resolution around the epsilon.
	// Some of that leftover resolution even goes away after we scale to points far away.

	// Here is a further discussion regarding the choice of smallestEpsilonAllowed.
	// In the 32 float world (we can assume vec_t is that), the "epsilon around 1.0" is
	// 0.00000011921.  In the 64 bit float world (we can assume double is that), the
	// "epsilon around 1.0" is 0.00000000000000022204.  (By the way these two epsilons
	// are defined as VEC_SMALLEST_EPSILON_AROUND_ONE VEC_ACCU_SMALLEST_EPSILON_AROUND_ONE
	// respectively.)  If you divide the first by the second, you get approximately
	// 536,885,246.  Dividing that number by 200,000 (a typical base winding coordinate)
	// gives 2684.  So in other words, if our smallestEpsilonAllowed was chosen as exactly
	// VEC_SMALLEST_EPSILON_AROUND_ONE, you would be guaranteed at least 2000 "ticks" in
	// 64-bit land inside of the epsilon for all numbers we're dealing with.
